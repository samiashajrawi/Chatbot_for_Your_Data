# Chatbot for Your Data
This chatbot will not just interact with users through text but also comprehend and answer questions related to the content of a specific document.


# Understanding the worker: Document processing and conversation

worker.py is part of a chatbot application that processes user messages and documents. It uses the langchain library, which is a Python library for building
conversational AI applications. It is responsible for setting up the language model, processing PDF documents into a format that can be used for conversation
retrieval, and handling user prompts to generate responses based on the processed documents. Here's a high-level overview of the script:
Open worker.py in IDE
Your task is to fill in the worker.py comments with the appropriate code.
Let's break down each section in the worker file.
The worker.py is designed to provide a conversational interface that can answer questions based on the contents of a given PDF document.

The diagram illustrates the procedure of document processing and information retrieval, seamlessly integrating a large language model (LLM) to facilitate the task
of question answering. The whole process happens in worker.py. image credit link.
1. Initialization init_llm():
  - Setting environment variables: The environment variable for the HuggingFace API token is set.
  - Loading the language model: The WatsonX language model is initialized with specified parameters.
  - Loading embeddings: Embeddings are initialized using a pre-trained model.
2. Document processing process_document(document_path):
This function is responsible for processing a given PDF document.
  - Loading the document: The document is loaded using PyPDFLoader.
  - Splitting text: The document is split into smaller chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
  - Creating embeddings database: An embeddings database is created from the text chunks using Chroma.
  - Setting Up the RetrievalQA chain: A RetrievalQA chain is set up to facilitate the question-answering process. This chain uses the initialized language
model and the embeddings database to answer questions based on the processed document.
3. User prompt processing process_prompt(prompt):
This function processes a user's prompt or question.
  - Receiving user prompt: The system receives a user prompt (question).
  - Querying the model: The model is queried using the retrieval chain, and it generates a response based on the processed document and previous chat
history.
  - Updating chat history: The chat history is updated with the new prompt and response.
